[[service-mesh-install_prerequisites]]
= {ProductName} installation prerequisites

Before you can install {ProductName}, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* Possess an active {product-title} subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.
* Install {product-title} version 3.11, or higher.   For more information about the system and environment requirements, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html/installing_clusters/install-config-install-prerequisites#system-requirements[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].
* Install the version of the {product-title} command line utility (the `oc` client tool) that matches your {product-title} version and add it to your path. For example, if you have {product-title} 3.11 you must have the matching `oc` client version 3.11. For installation instructions, see the {product-title} https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/cli_reference/#installing-the-cli[Command Line Reference] document.


[[preparing-openshift-installation]]
== Preparing the {product-title} installation

Before you can install the {ProductShortName} into an {product-title} installation, you must modify the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes. These changes enable the features that are required in the {ProductShortName} and also ensure that Elasticsearch features function correctly.

[[updating-master-configuration]]
== Updating the master configuration

Service mesh relies on the existence of a proxy sidecar within the application's pod to provide service mesh capabilities to the application. You can enable automatic sidecar injection or manage it manually. We recommend automatic injection, using the annotation with no need to label namespaces, to ensure that your application contains the appropriate configuration for your service mesh upon deployment. This method requires fewer privileges and does not conflict with other OpenShift capabilities such as builder pods.

[NOTE]
====
 The upstream community version of Istio injects the sidecar by default if you have labeled the namespace. You are not required to label the namespace with {ProductName}. However, {ProductName} requires you to opt-in to having the sidecar automatically injected to a deployment. This is to avoid injecting a sidecar where it is not wanted (for example build or deploy pods).
====

To enable the automatic injection of the {ProductShortName} sidecar you must first modify the master configuration on each master to include support for webhooks and signing of Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).

Make the following changes on each master within your {product-title} installation:

. Change to the directory containing the master configuration file (for example, /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml).
. Create a file named `master-config.patch` with the following contents:
+
```
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    MutatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
    ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
```
+
. In the same directory, issue the following commands to apply the patch to the `master-config.yaml` file:
+
```
$ cp -p master-config.yaml master-config.yaml.prepatch
$ oc ex config patch master-config.yaml.prepatch -p "$(cat master-config.patch)" > master-config.yaml
$ /usr/local/bin/master-restart api && /usr/local/bin/master-restart controllers
```

[[automatic-sidecar-injection]]
=== Automatic sidecar injection
Automatic injection of the sidecar is supported through the use of an annotation within your application's yaml file. The name of the annotation is `sidecar.istio.io/inject` and its value must be set to `true` for injection to occur.

This example shows the annotation used within the sleep test application. The additional proxy related containers are included when you create the application in the OpenShift cluster.

      - name: sleep

[[manual-sidecar-injection]]
=== Manual sidecar injection

[NOTE]
When you use manual sidecar injection, ensure that you have access to a running cluster so the correct configuration can be obtained from the istio-sidecar-injector configmap within the istio-system namespace.

Manual injection of the sidecar is supported through the upstream `istioctl` command. To obtain the executable and deploy an application using manual injection you should:

- Download the appropriate https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/tag/1.0.4[installation] for your OS
- Unpack the installation into a directory and include the bin directory in your PATH

Once installed you can inject the sidecar into your application by executing the following command:

```
istioctl kube-inject -f app.yaml | oc create -f -
```
This command injects the containers into the application's yaml configuration and pipes the modified configuration to the oc command to create the deployments.


[[updating-node-configuration]]
== Updating the node configuration

To run the Elasticsearch application, you must make a change to the kernel configuration on each node.  This change is handled through the `sysctl` service.

Make the following changes on each node within your {product-title} installation:

. Create a file named `/etc/sysctl.d/99-elasticsearch.conf` with the following contents:
+
`vm.max_map_count = 262144`
+
. Execute the following command:
+
```
$ sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
```
