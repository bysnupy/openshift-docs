* The istio-init container requires a privileged security context or at least to run as root and to have the NET_ADMIN capability.  The istio-init container needs to be privileged because it needs to properly configure the iptables rules in the pod to intercept network connections.  The team is currently investigating ideas for ways to reduce the privileges required by Istio.

https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[KIALI-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11.  This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer.  In order to access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.
